# Rosetta Code

The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another. -- https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code

## Branches

- `main`: the branch with implemented code, the default branch
- `init`: the branch with only initialized setup, good for customization
